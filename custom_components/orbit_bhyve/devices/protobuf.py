"""Protobuf-protocol device family (frame magic 0x11): HT34A XD + HT25G2 Gen2.

These devices share one wire protocol end to end — the same framing, AES-CTR
cipher, `timerMode` start/stop messages, and protobuf RX status decode. The
only per-model differences are the human-readable log label and the station
count (already carried as `self.stations`), so the actuation logic lives once
here and the per-model modules (`ht34a.py`, `ht25g2.py`) are trivial subclasses.

Per-*protocol* device modules are justified (mesh vs protobuf vs hub); per-
*model* modules within a protocol are not — collapsing the two identical Gen2/XD
classes removes a confirm-and-retry implementation that had been written twice.

TX frame builders live here; the RX decode + CRC live in `status.py`. The CRC
and inner-message header are shared with the RX side, imported rather than
re-declared, so there is a single source for both directions.
