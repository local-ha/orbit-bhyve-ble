# Orbit B-Hyve BLE — Home Assistant integration

**Local BLE control for Orbit B-Hyve hose-tap and XD timers.** Cloud is
contacted only at setup to discover devices and fetch network keys. After
setup, every command and state poll is BLE-only — your timers keep working
when the WAN goes down.

## Supported hardware

## Install via HACS (recommended)

1. **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ menu → Custom repositories**
2. URL: `https://github.com/ljmerza/orbit-bhyve-ble` — Category: **Integration**
3. Click **Install** on **Orbit B-Hyve BLE**
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Orbit B-Hyve BLE"**
6. Enter your Orbit cloud email + password — the integration discovers all
   devices on the account and fetches each one's BLE network key

## Manual install

1. Copy `custom_components/orbit_bhyve/` into `<config>/custom_components/`
2. Restart HA
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Orbit B-Hyve BLE"**

## What you get

Per discovered sprinkler device:

- **Valve** per physical station (HT25 = 1, HT34A = up to 4) — uses
  `valve.open_valve` / `valve.close_valve`. Open/closed state is
  **optimistic** (derived from the last command, not from a decoded
  device status).
- **Battery (%)** sensor — live, BLE-sourced. Decoded from the device's
  info-ack frame on every poll, no cloud round-trip after setup.
- **Battery voltage (mV)** sensor — same source as the percent sensor;
  disabled by default, enable it from the entity's settings if you want
  the raw reading.
- **Default watering duration** (`number` entity, minutes) — per device.
  The valve uses this when `start_watering` is called without an
  explicit duration. Restored across HA restarts.
- **Sync** button per device — forces a fresh BLE connect + init
  handshake. Useful after a long idle, or to refresh the battery
  reading on demand without waiting for the next poll.
- Manufacturer / model / firmware / MAC are exposed via the device's
  "Device info" panel.

Hubs (`BH1-0001`) are filtered out at discovery — they don't actuate
anything, so they don't appear in the device picker or the device
registry.

## Services

- `orbit_bhyve.start_watering` — `entity_id` + optional `duration` (sec)
- `orbit_bhyve.stop_all` — stop everything on the targeted device
- `orbit_bhyve.refresh_devices` — re-query the cloud (for new devices, key
  rotation, or fw changes); manual, no background polling

## Options flow

- **Default watering duration** (sec) — used when `start_watering` is called
  without an explicit duration
- **Disconnect after idle** (sec) — pooled BLE connection closes after this
  many seconds idle to free the proxy slot
- **Polling interval — idle** (sec) — how often to refresh state when no
  station is watering
- **Polling interval — watering** (sec) — faster polling while a station is
  active

## How it works

1. **Setup**: log into Orbit cloud once → fetch device list → fetch one AES
   network key per mesh → cache everything in the config entry
2. **Per command**: the integration's pooled BLE connection (one per device)
   does an AES handshake, runs the model-specific init sequence on first
   connect, then sends one encrypted frame per command and reads back
   notifications
3. **Reuse**: the connection stays open across commands until idle timeout;
   subsequent commands skip the handshake and init, going directly to the
   command frame

The cipher (AES-128-ECB used as a CTR-style keystream, frame trailer =
`sum(plaintext) + magic + len`) was reverse-engineered against captured
phone-app traffic. Different hardware families (HT25 vs HT34A) use different
inner plaintext formats and different magic bytes; the per-model device
classes encode that. Adding a new model = drop a `devices/htXX.py` and
register it.
