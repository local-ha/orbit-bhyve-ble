**Local BLE control for Orbit B-Hyve hose-tap and XD timers.** Cloud is
contacted only at setup to discover devices and fetch network keys. After
setup, every command and state poll is BLE-only — your timers keep working
when the WAN goes down.

## Install via HACS (recommended)

1. **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ menu → Custom repositories**
2. URL: `https://github.com/ljmerza/orbit-bhyve-ble` — Category: **Integration**
3. Click **Install** on **Orbit B-Hyve BLE**
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Orbit B-Hyve BLE"**
6. Enter your Orbit cloud email + password — the integration discovers all
   devices on the account and fetches each one's BLE network key

## Manual install

1. Copy `custom_components/orbit_bhyve/` into `<config>/custom_components/`
2. Restart HA
3. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Orbit B-Hyve BLE"**

## What you get

Per discovered sprinkler device:

- **Valve** per physical station (HT25 = 1, HT34A/HT34 = up to 4) — uses
  `valve.open_valve` / `valve.close_valve`. Open/closed state is
  **optimistic** (derived from the last command, not from a decoded
  device status).
- **Battery (%)** sensor — live, BLE-sourced. Decoded from the device's
  info-ack frame on every poll, no cloud round-trip after setup. The percent
  is a linear voltage gauge whose discharge curve is chosen by the **Battery
  chemistry** selector below.
- **Battery voltage (mV)** sensor — same source as the percent sensor;
  disabled by default, enable it from the entity's settings if you want
  the raw reading.
- **Battery chemistry** (`select`, config category) — the AA cell chemistry
  you installed (**Alkaline** / **Ni-MH rechargeable** / **Lithium primary**
  / **Lithium regulated 1.5 V**), which selects the voltage→percent curve.
  Chemistry can't be auto-detected from a single voltage reading (2550 mV
  could be alkaline at 25% or Ni-MH at 80%), so it defaults to Alkaline
  (Orbit's stock assumption) and you set it per device; changing it re-gauges
  the percent immediately, no device round-trip. **Note:** regulated 1.5 V
  Li-Ion cells output a constant voltage until they abruptly cut off, so no
  percentage gauge can track them — the percent reads full right up until the
  valve dies. Watch the voltage sensor instead.
- **Signal strength (RSSI)** sensor — the BLE advertisement RSSI from
  Home Assistant's bluetooth manager (works even while disconnected);
  disabled by default.
- **Connected** and **Watering** binary sensors — device connectivity
  (diagnostic) and whether a station is currently running, for automations
  and dashboards.
- **Problem** binary sensor (protobuf family) — the device's own fault
  report: pump, battery, voltage-boost, flow anomalies and per-station
  faults, with each flag as an attribute. On flow-capable Gen2 valves two
  dedicated sensors ride along: **Leak detected** (water moving while the
  valve is commanded closed) and **No flow** (valve open but nothing
  flowing; disabled by default until field-confirmed — you can test it by
  starting a run with the faucet closed).
- **Default watering duration** (`number` entity, minutes) — per device.
  The valve uses this when `start_watering` is called without an
  explicit duration. Restored across HA restarts.
- **Sync** button per device — forces a fresh BLE connect + init
  handshake. Useful after a long idle, or to refresh the battery
  reading on demand without waiting for the next poll.
- **Mesh live status** (HT25, opt-in option) — by default mesh timers are
  polled passively (state comes from command acks + a wall-clock timer, to
  spare the AA batteries). Turning on **Mesh live status poll** makes each
  idle poll connect and read the device's real watering state, countdown
  and battery — so runs started from the B-Hyve app or a hub schedule show
  up in HA within one poll. Costs roughly 96 BLE connects/day at the
  default 15-minute cadence.
- **Identify** button (protobuf family) — flashes the device LED (#47)
  so you can physically locate it. No-op on the XD, which ignores it.
- **Automatic watering** switch — the device-global controller mode
  (auto vs. off). When off, stored programs don't run.
- **Program A–D** enable switches + summary sensors — each stored
  program slot's on/off enable bit, plus a sensor showing its schedule
  (days, start times, per-zone durations). A slot with no stored program
  reads `unavailable`.
- **Next run** sensor — the device-computed next scheduled program start
  (timestamp), with the program letter(s) as an attribute.
- **Flow rate** and **Water used** sensors (flow-capable Gen2 valves) —
  instantaneous GPM sampled from the inline flow sensor on each watering
  poll, plus a cumulative gallons total integrated from it that plugs
  straight into HA's Water dashboard (no Integration helper needed; the
  total is restored across restarts). Calibrate with the **Flow
  calibration** option below. A diagnostic **Flow rate (device)** sensor
  (disabled by default) records the device's own reported GPM field to
  confirm whether it ever populates.
- **Flow rate** and **Water used** sensors (HT25 fw0085, opt-in) — litres per
  minute and a per-run litre total, decoded from the timer's own inline flow
  meter over an undocumented BLE subscription. The total is a per-run counter,
  so `TOTAL_INCREASING` treats each run as a meter reset and HA's long-term
  statistics book clean deltas; it plugs into the Water dashboard without an
  Integration helper. Both sensors read `unavailable` until **Flow
  measurement** is switched on for that device.
- **Flow measurement** (`switch`, config category, HT25) — per-device opt-in,
  **off by default**, and worth understanding before you turn it on.
  Measuring holds the timer's single BLE session open for the whole program
  and re-subscribes every 240 s, because the device stops sampling about 300
  seconds after each subscription no matter how many samples were requested.
  That is more radio-on time than the **Mesh live status poll** below, and
  while the session is held the B-hyve app and any status poll are locked out
  of that timer. Flipping the switch sends nothing over BLE — it only decides
  whether the *next* run subscribes; turning it off mid-run stops measuring
  immediately and hands the connection back.
- **Flow calibration** (`number`, counts per litre, config category, HT25) —
  per-device, restored across restarts. The meter reports raw tick counts and
  this converts them to litres, so it is specific to your plumbing. Four HT25
  fw0085 units calibrated against the vendor app measured **113–118**; the
  default of 112 therefore over-reports slightly until you set yours. To
  calibrate, run the same duration twice on one tap — once from the B-hyve app
  and once from Home Assistant — then
  `new = current × (HA litres ÷ app litres)`. Run them back to back so mains
  pressure doesn't drift, and use a long enough run (10 minutes is ample) that
  single-tick resolution is negligible. The number stays settable while Flow
  measurement is off, so a known value can be entered before the first
  measured run.

  > **Only runs started through Home Assistant are measured**, including the
  > `orbit_bhyve.start_watering` service. The subscription is issued as part
  > of the start sequence, so a run triggered from the timer's physical button
  > or from the B-hyve app produces no flow data.
- Manufacturer / model / firmware / MAC are exposed via the device's
  "Device info" panel.
- **Download diagnostics** — the integration and each device support HA's
  standard diagnostics download (Settings → Devices & Services → ⋮ →
  Download diagnostics): device records, live state and poll health, with
  credentials and BLE network keys redacted. Attach it to bug reports.

Hubs (`BH1-0001`) are filtered out at discovery — they don't actuate
anything, so they don't appear in the device picker or the device
registry.

## Services

- `orbit_bhyve.start_watering` — `entity_id` + optional `duration` (sec)
- `orbit_bhyve.stop_all` — stop everything on the targeted device
- `orbit_bhyve.refresh_devices` — re-query the cloud (for new devices, key
  rotation, or fw changes); manual, no background polling
- `orbit_bhyve.get_program` — read back a program slot (A–F) as structured
  data (`SupportsResponse.ONLY`): days, start times, per-zone durations
- `orbit_bhyve.set_program` — store/replace a program in a slot: watering
  days (weekdays / even / odd / every-N-days), start time(s), per-zone
  run durations. Optionally enable it in the same call
- `orbit_bhyve.delete_program` — clear a program slot

> **Watering programs are for non-Smart slots.** The device stores up to six
> program slots; this integration reads and writes their schedules over BLE.
> Slots are read back from the device's `#10` sync dump (a multi-frame reply
> reassembled over the connection), so `get_program` and the Program sensors
> reflect what's actually stored — including programs created in the B-Hyve
> app. For richer scheduling logic, drive `start_watering` from
> `irrigation_unlimited` or HA's Smart Irrigation instead.

## Options flow

- **Default watering duration** (sec) — used when `start_watering` is called
  without an explicit duration
- **Disconnect after idle** (sec) — pooled BLE connection closes after this
  many seconds idle to free the proxy slot
- **Polling interval — idle** (sec) — how often to refresh state when no
  station is watering
- **Polling interval — watering** (sec) — faster polling while a station is
  active
- **Flow calibration** (counts per gallon) — converts the **Gen2** flow
  counter to gallons; default 433 was bucket-measured. Re-calibrate by
  comparing `Water used` against a bucket/meter over one run. This option
  does nothing on Gen1 HT25 timers: those calibrate per device via the **Flow
  calibration** *number entity*, in counts per **litre** — see "What you get"
  above
- **Mesh live status poll** (bool, default off) — HT25 mesh timers connect
  over BLE on each idle poll to read live watering state and battery.
  Battery trade-off: ~96 connects/day at the default idle cadence

## How it works

1. **Setup**: log into Orbit cloud once → fetch device list → fetch one AES
   network key per mesh → cache everything in the config entry
2. **Per command**: the integration's pooled BLE connection (one per device)
   does an AES handshake, runs the model-specific init sequence on first
   connect, then sends one encrypted frame per command and reads back
   notifications
3. **Reuse**: the connection stays open across commands until idle timeout.
   Watering commands re-run the model init/bind first — the device silently
   ignores a watering frame sent on a stale bind — while reads reuse the
   pooled session directly. Marginal proxy links get a bounded handshake with
   a few clean retries instead of a wedged connection.

The cipher (AES-128-ECB used as a CTR-style keystream, frame trailer =
`sum(plaintext) + magic + len`) was reverse-engineered against captured
phone-app traffic. Different hardware families (HT25 vs HT34A) use different
inner plaintext formats and different magic bytes; the per-model device
classes encode that. Adding a new model = drop a `devices/htXX.py` and
register it.

## Credits

The marginal-link connection hardening (bounded handshake + retry, capped
write-ack), the per-command re-bind for HT25 actuation, the RSSI and
connectivity/watering sensors, and the HT34/HT34A battery + watering-status
decode were ported from
[@stuartdenne](https://github.com/stuartdenne/ha-orbit-bhyve-ble-old)'s fork.
